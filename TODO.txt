Tasks I may forget to do later

Sprites:
----------------------------------------------------------------
	- Create two spritesheet access functions - one to get a 16
	  x16 sprite, and another to get a custom sized chunk of the
	  spritesheet

Lua API:
----------------------------------------------------------------
	- When making engine modules/tables make a `Colors` table
	  that has integers `blue`, `green`, etc. so that the user
	  can just type `Colors.blue` and use the blue color 
	  (drawing functions use integers for colors)
		- Do the same thing for input - each button has a
		  number, but the user can just type `Buttons.left`
